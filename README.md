# Unsupervised Domain Adaptation
Unsupervised Domain adaptation is a subfield of machine learning that focuses on transferring knowledge from a source domain to a target domain, where the target domain has no labeled data. This project explores various techniques and methodologies for unsupervised domain adaptation (UDA) to improve model performance on unseen data.

## Overview

This repository contains implementations and detailed reports for the Unsupervised Domain Adaptation (UDA) project. UDA is a machine learning paradigm that aims to adapt models trained on a source domain to perform well on a target domain without requiring labeled data from the target domain.
